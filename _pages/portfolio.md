## Conference Presentation: So You're Considering Brownfield

Faced with the question of "Should I go with a brownfield approach, or should I go with greenfield?" when trying to adopt React Native with an existing product, it's hard to feel certain in your decision. In late 2018 and 2019, I worked on two teams simultaneously that took different approaches. I will present our own justifications for each approach, what issues we encountered unique to each decision, and the outcomes we had. I'll also present a decision making framework to help inform future decisions of "greenfield vs brownfield". 

This was presented on September 6, 2019 at React Native EU in Wroclaw, Poland. It can be viewed [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJC2XPFe-I0).

## Pilot Research: Learning Rapidly Changing Frameworks

As part of my graduate studies at Georgia Institute of Technology, I conducted research on learning in technology. This was survey research, with the focus being how developers learn rapidly changing frameworks. The research was focused on what tools were used, how quickly the learning was applied, and whether it was in response to a pressing need (e.g. a bug, change in the framework, or foreign requirement). This research is still in progress, and the materials can be found in [its repository](https://www.turnrye.com/learning-rapidly-changing-frameworks/).

## App: Pedi Pro for EMS

Pedi Pro for EMS helps emergency medical professionals calculate vitals, drug dosing, and various other tools. This is an ongoing project written in React Native for iOS and Android. The source and store listings can be found in [its repository](https://www.turnrye.com/pedipro/).
