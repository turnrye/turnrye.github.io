title: "Becoming an Autonomous System"
---

I dreamt of starting an ISP when I was young. I was always jealous of friends who had better internet service and particularly frustrated when downtime got in the way of gaming. This dream has stuck with me, and this year I made another step forward. I got everything needed to become my own ISP from ARIN.

Thanks to [Kenneth Finnegan's blogpost](https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2017/11/creating-autonomous-system-for-fun-and.html) and [nigelvh](http://digitalnigel.com/), I had a bit of guidance to help. Rather than restating what they could tell you, I'm going to focus on my experience of getting these leases as a sole proprietor.

## Create your account and organization

In order to get started with ARIN, you'll need to [make an account](https://account.arin.net/public/login). This is where you'll be able to submit requests, make payments, and manage your data.

Once you're in, you can [create an organization](https://account.arin.net/public/secure/org/create/start). In my case it was "Ryan Turner Sole Proprietor". For ARIN's purposes, if you're operating as an individual without a separate business entity, you have "Sole Proprietory" in the name. That worked out nicely for me, as my org ID is the punny "RTSP". Part of the signup will include creating your organization contacts. Note that the contact information that you enter will be published publicly, so consider your privacy needs.

Once I submitted the application, ARIN requested that I attach a picture of my ID and a notarized affidavit confirming the name with which I conduct business. That essentially meant writing that I do internet stuff and I use my name for that.

This process took about 5 days end-to-end, and it was free.

## Get an IPv6 block

Now that you're recognized as an organization, you can request IPs. I plan to use these IPs for my homelab, networking with the WAN I mentioned earlier, and offering a few services to friends and family. Due to this, by ARIN's definition I am an ISP rather than an end user. In this case, I knew I'd use it in my basement cabinet and at a separate colo facility. I don't have plans to go well beond this, and as a result an ISP-Small allocation of `/36` is plenty.

So I next submitted an [IP Address request](https://account.arin.net/public/secure/resources/request) including those details. In order for ARIN to approve this request, you have to prove that you have network service; for me that meant including the sales order for my dedicated internet access.

Additionally, whenver you request address space from ARIN, you must include an [officer attestation](https://www.arin.net/about/corporate/agreements/attestation/).

Once approved, you'll be sent to their financial team to pay an invoice. In this case the fee was $500, but the schedule varies depending on what you request.

In about 7 days, I became the proud lesee of 2602:FDAB::/36.

## Get an IPv4 block

Once you have your IPv6 block assigned (you can't do this any sooner), you can request a free IPv4 /24 for IPv6 Deployment facilitation. You'll need to provide justification for this, but it's straight forward if you're familiar with what IPv6 is and what it means to be multistack'd. Basically, if you have an honest use for your IPv6 block, then you also have a use for a small IPv4 block. In my case, I intend to use it for DNS and NAT64. That way my internal networks can be 100% IPv6. You may take a similar or different approach.

In about 7 days start to finish, I was the proud lesee of 23.143.48.0/24 for $0.

## Register your Autonomous System (AS)

Finally, in order to be multihomed I needed my own AS number. In my case, this is actually where I started. I already had an IPv4 block subleased. Nevertheless, you can do this should last as well if you aren't entering into this process with an address block.

Registering an autonomous system (AS) lets you specify routing policies for how the internet sees your networks. Essentially, you get an unique identification number, and then you can use it with routing protocols with your peers. This is particularly important if you plan to be multihomed so that you avoid juggling private ASNs. As I wanted to maintain some new equipment in my basement but also some in the colo, that made my system multisite and multihomed. I needed an ASN, so I asked for one.

When submitting the request, I had to include proof of multiple network providers. Since I had an existing network to point to, that really meant I only needed to include details for the new service provider. I provided the master services agreement and sales order form from my new provider, which satisfied the criteria. The last step was to sign a registration services agreement, which I'll mention more shortly.

After about a week, I received AS397968.

## Switch to the Registration Services Plan

Finally, in order to have a more manageable annual bill, it makes sense to switch to a registration services plan. From this, you can save money on annual renewals. In my case, since I'm an ISP, this was taken care of for me. Otherwise, I would have needed to submit a support ticket requesting that my account be changed to a 2X-Small service category Registration Services Plan.

## Now what

Now, it's just a matter of putting these resources to use! I have a freshly minted ASN that I can use for BGP with network providers, my own IP space to use to segment my own personal resources from my friend's and client's resources, and the opportunity to get experience doing something that a select group gets.

This experience overall was great. I learned a bit about how ARIN works, and now I am a voting member too. If you're interested in learning more about how the internet works, especially on the business side, consider this as a good learning opportunity. Good job ARIN for running through this entire process before I could even get my network provider scheduled for installation -- most steps took about a week, but I hope with this information you can anticipate some of what's needed and speed up your own experience.
